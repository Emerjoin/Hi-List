# Hi-List
An extensible Hi-Framework UI component for data listing - easy pagination, filtering and ordering

## This component:
* is extensible
* is configurable
* uses bootstrap components
* is ours (including you)
* is awesome!

# Using Hi-List
## A simple list
```html
<list name="list1" each="row" src="SomeFrontier.methodName" repeat-element=".myElement">

     <item class="myElement">
         {{row.attribute}}   
     </item>

</list>
```

### Examplaining the attributes
All the attributes present on that list element are mandatory. There shouldn't be a list without any of that attributes.
#### name
It defines the name of your list instance and you can use such name
to access the list public API from your view. Checkout the following example:

```javascript
//some code here
  $scope.list1.publicMethod(params);
//some code here
```

#### each
Defines the variable name that is used within the repeatable element to access the row's attributes.

#### src 
Defines the frontier method that should be used as data source.

#### repeat-element
Defines the element that should be repeated for each row. Receives a jquery selector.

### The Frontier method
A valid frontier method to be used as a list data source should receive 4 arguments: the desired page, the maximum items per page, the filter details and the ordering settings. 

```java

@Frontier
@ApplicationScoped
public class SomeFrontier{

    public Map methodName(int pageNumber, int itemsPerPage, Map filter, Map ordering){
          
          int totalMatchedPages;
          Object[] rows;
          int totalMachedRows;
          
          //Consult your database here and set the variables above
          
          return HiList.listEncode(rows, totalMachedRows, pageNumber, totalMatchedPages)
    
    }

}
```

## Tweking the list

### Adding a seach box 

#### Inside the list
```html
   <list ...>
   
     <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->
      
      <input type="text" ng-model="filter.text"/>
      
      <!--Other elements might also be placed here-->
        
   </list>
```

#### Outside the list
```html
   ...
   
   <input type="text" ng-model="myList.filter.text"/>
   
   ...
```

A change on the **filter.text** value will result in a refresh.

### Server is taking too long
Hi-List will set the variable *$delaying* to *true* once it detects the server delay. 
You can have a DOM element that is displayed when the delay is detected. Check the following example:
```html
<list ...>

   <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->

   <div ng-show="$delaying">
      <p>Please wait...</p>
   </div>
   
   <!--Other elements might also be placed here-->
   
</list>
```

You can also define the delay detection time in milliseconds. All you have to do is to set the attribute *delay* on your list element. Check the following example, the server delay will be detected after 1 second waiting for the server reply:
```html
<list ...delay="1000" ...>

   <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->
   
</list>
```

### The server returned an empty array of rows
Hi-List will set the variable *$empty* to *true* once it receives an empty array of rows.
You can also have a DOM element that is displayed is such situations. Check the following example:
```html
<list ...>

   <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->

   <div ng-show="$empty">
      <p>There is no match on the database</p>
   </div>
   
   <!--Other elements might also be placed here-->
   
</list>
```
When the server returns an empty array of rows, the pagination is not displayed.

### Intercepting the fetch operation from a view
**What is the fetch operation?** Is when the Hi-List component attempts to fetch data from Server.<br>
**Why would you want to intercept such operation?** To change the input or the outcome. 
Changing the input means: add filtering properties. Changing the outcome means: changing the rows composition or even adding rows.

#### Changing the input
There two ways this can be achieved. The first one is using an extension and the second is using a function on your view scope.
The first approach is discussed on the extensions section. Lets see how we can change the inputs of the fetch operation from a function of a view scope:

##### Define the function
```javascript

...
   
   //This interceptor will add a date parameter to the filter
   $scope.interceptor = function(filter){
      
         filter.date = "2016-07-28";
   
   };

...
```
##### Letting the Hi-List component know about the function
```html
   <list ...preFetch="interceptor(filter)"...>
   
      <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->
      
   </list>
```

**MAKE SURE THE PARAMETER YOU PASS TO YOUR FUNCTION IS ALWAYS "filter".**

#### Changing the outcome
There are also two ways this can be achieved. The first one again is using an extension and the second one is using a function on your view's scope. Let's see how do achieve this from a view's scope function.

##### Defining the function
```javascript
...

   //This will add a new property (checked) to every matched row
   $scope.transformer = function(result){
      
         result.data.forEach(function(row){
            
            row.checked = true;
            
         });
   
   }

....

```

##### Leting the Hi-List component know about the function

```html

   <list ...postFetch="transformer(result)"...>
   
      <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->
      
   </list>

```

**MAKE SURE THE PARAMETER YOU PASS TO YOUR FUNCTION IS ALWAYS "result".**<br>
Check the extensions sections to see how to achieve the same goal from an extension.

### Changing maximum items per page
There two ways this can be done: from the markup and from javascript code.

#### From markup
```html

   <!--Setting 78 as the maximum items per page value-->
   <list ...per-page="78"...>
   
      <!--Your repeatable element and other stuff might be placed here-->
      
   </list>

```

#### From Javascript
```javascript
   ...
      
      //Setting 78 as the maximum items per page value
      $scope.myList.show.maxItems = 78;
   
   ...
```


## Manipulating the List from its methods
```javascript
//Refreshing the current page
$scope.listName.refresh();

//Going to specific page
$scope.listName.goToPage(number);

//Go to the last page
$scope.listName.goToLastPage();

//Go to the first page
$scope.listName.gotToFirstPage();

//Go to the next page
$scope.listName.goToNextPage();

//Go to the previous page
$scope.listName.goToPreviousPage();
```

# Extensions
The Hi-List is extensible. This means you can extend its capabilities creating your own extensions.
## Enabling an extension
Just add the attribute *extensions* and set as value a list of extensions separated by space.
Example:
```html
<list ... extensions="extension1 extension2" ...>
    <!--You list content-->
</list>
```

## Creating your own extension

### Basic extension
```javascript
hiList.extend(function(extension){

    return {

        name:"extension1", //The extension name
        singleton:false, //If true, there will only be one instance of this extension for all the lists
        build: function(){

            //Override the instance methods here
            extension.$startup = function(){

                //This method is invoked when creating the extension instance

            };
            
             extension.apiSetup = function($scope, attrs){

                //Your extension can add methods to the list instance scope from here

            };

            extension.transformRepeatable = function($scope,attrs,transformable){

               //This method allows your extension to change the list repeatable element.
               //Use transformable.repeatable to access the jQuery DOM element object.

            };

            extension.transformHtml = function($scope,attrs,transformable){

                //This method allows your extension to change list generated HTML.
                //Use transformable.html to access the jQuery DOM element object.

            };

            extension.preFetch = function($scope, filter){

                //Invoked before the fetch operation begin. 
                //Allows an extension to manipulate the filter 

            };

            extension.postFetch = function($scope, result){

                //Invoked when the fetch operation finishes successfully. 
                //Allows an extension to manipulate the result before it gets displayed

            };


            extension.fetchFail = function($scope, filter, ordering){

                //Invoked when the fetch operation fails. 

            };

            extension.fetchFinished = function($scope){

                //Invoked when the fetch operation finishes. 
                //Doesnt matter if it failed or not, this function is always invoked

            };

            extension.invalidResult = function($scope){

                //This function is invoked when the list receives an invalid result from frontier method

            };

            return extension;

        }

    };

});
```

### Injecting services into an extension
```javascript
hiList.extend(function(extension){

    return {

        name:"extension1", //The extension name
        inject : ['$compile'],
        singleton:false, //If true, there will only be one instance of this extension for all the lists
        build: function($compile){
        
            //...
            
            extension.$startup = function(){

               

            };
            
            //...
            
            return extension;

        }

    };

});
```
